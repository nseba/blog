My expertise lies in architecting and designing industrial distributed software, which has been my primary focus for the past 15 years. Lately, I've been honing my skills in microservices running on Kubernetes, as I'm always eager to stay ahead of the curve with the latest technology trends. Solving complex challenges and embracing innovation is what fuels my passion for software development, and I'm committed to making a significant impact in this ever-evolving field.
